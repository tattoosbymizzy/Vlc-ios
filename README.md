## Requirements
* Xcode 9.0+
* macOS 10.12+
* Cocoapods 1.4+

## Building

### VLC-iOS

1. Run `pod update`
2. Open `VLC.xcworkspace`.
3. Hit "Build and Run".

### Custom VLCkit

Mostly for debugging or advanced users, you might want to have a custom local VLCKit build.

1. Clone VLCKit:

    `git clone https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit.git`


2. Inside the VLCKit folder, run the following command:

    `./buildMobileVLCKit.sh -a ${MYARCH}`

    MYARCH can be `i386` `x86_64` `armv7` `armv7s` or `aarch64`.

    Add `-d` for a debug build (to have valid stack straces and asserts).

    Add `-n` if you want to use you own VLC repository for VLCKit (See [VLCKit README.md](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit/blob/master/README.md)).

3. Replace the MobileVLCKit.framework with the one you just build.

    Inside your vlc-ios folder, after a `pod update`, do:

    `cd Pods/MobileVLCKit-unstable/MobileVLCKit-binary`

    `rm -rf MobileVLCKit.framework`

    `ln -s ${VLCKit}/build/MobileVLCKit.framework`

4. Hit "Build and Run".
